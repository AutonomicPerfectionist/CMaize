CMakePackagingProject
=====================

CMakePackagingProject is the top-level project of the CMakePP organization. It
is this project which package maintainers should use to write their projects'
build systems. Consequently, the CMakePackagingProject's documentation is the
documentation to consult for generic help when it comes to building a project
that uses CMakePP.
